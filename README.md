Coding and Pull Request Conventions
-----------
* We generally follow the Sun/Oracle coding standards.
* No tabs; use 4 spaces instead.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* No CRLF line endings, LF only, put your gits 'core.autocrlf' on 'true'
* No 80 column limit or 'weird' mid-statement new lines.
* The number of commits in a pull request should be kept to a minimum (squish them into one most of the time - use common sense!).
* No merges should be included in pull requests unless the pull request's purpose is a merge.
* Pull requests should be tested (does it compile AND does it work?) before submission.

Follow the above conventions if you want your pull requests accepted.
